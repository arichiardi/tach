# Tach

Leiningen plugin for testing libs targeting self-hosted ClojureScript.

# Usage

Add `lein-tach` to your Leiningen `:plugins` vector.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/lein-tach.svg)](https://clojars.org/lein-tach)

Run via 

```
lein tach {self-host-env}

lein tach {self-host-env} {build-id}
```

The `self-host-env` can be either `lumo` or `planck`.

If specified, `{build-id}` is used to identify the `:cljsbuild` build. (Otherwise the first is used.) 

The `:cljsbuild` build is used to extract:

- source paths (it uses the `:source-paths` value)
- the main test runner namespace (assumed to be the one listed under `:main`)

You can override the main test runner namespace by including configuration like the following in your `project.clj`:

```
{:tach {:test-runner-namespace 'my.test-runner}}
```

In order to enable verbose logging, include config like the following in `project.clj`:

```
{:tach {:debug? true}}
```
